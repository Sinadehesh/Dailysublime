        question: "How long is each daily edition?",
        answer: "Between 2 and 7 minutes. Short enough to fit into any morning, long enough to actually change your attention for the day.",

      {
        question: "Do I need any background in art?",

      },
      {
        question: "What do I actually do in the meditation?",
